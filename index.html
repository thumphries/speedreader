    <div class="dropcap"></div>
    <p>I read a news article the other day about a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2556889/Teenager-jailed-stabbing-girl-face-smashing-anothers-head-against-fence-called-Harry-Potter.html">teenage boy who was jailed</a>
after viciously attacking two girls who followed him around, teasing him for
wearing glasses, and calling him a Harry Potter. If you look at the rather
disturbing photos of what happened as a result, all I can say is: hell hath no
fury like a bullied nerd who finally snaps.</p>

<p>Our society is incredibly hostile to geeks from birth. So I <em>understand</em> why
Ryan snapped. However at the same time, I pity those poor girls, who paid a
very dear price to learn a life lesson about the consequences of cruelty. They
had the <span>mis</span>fortune of witnessing the wrath of a lifetime of abuse,
poured out all at once on just two people. Those girls didn&rsquo;t just suffer for
their own sins, but the sins of every bully who came before them.</p>

<p>I honestly and sincerely believe that nerdy kids ought to be segregated in
schools. We used to have special schools for the gifted, where nerdy children
could go and not be constantly tormented by goading, violence, and gossip. Such
concepts are just completely alien to a geek&rsquo;s nature. But I suspect gifted
schools got phased out with the rise of the all-enveloping narrative of
equality.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine how awful and widespread the emotional
consequences have been for the people who&rsquo;ve suffered this sort of abuse. And
imagine how much it&rsquo;s reduced our economic output! We&rsquo;ve handicapped ourselves
as a nation, because we subject our best and brightest—the children who have
<em>the most</em> to offer to society—to a childhood of absolute torture, ridicule,
and inferior schooling. heresareallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreallylongword</p>

<p>Now if there were any justice in schools, bullies would be dragged out into the
street, beaten with a garden hose, and the government would send their parents
a bill to clean the blood off the pavement. But that&rsquo;ll never happen, because
most people in our society are bullies. The teachers are bullies. The children
are bullies. No matter what they say, they&rsquo;re never going to stick up for the
nerdy kid. And even if they did, it actually makes things worse. If a teacher
saves a child from bullies, it reinforces the perception he can&rsquo;t survive in
the social environment on his own merits. It also robs him of his pride.</p>

<p>Even if schools were reformed to the point where they policed all the
neurotypical children, surveilled students, and punished bullies with an iron
fist&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, I honestly feel that&rsquo;s cruel too. Why must we force
muggle children to suffer through re-education programs to change their
behaviour? Despite what Marxists claim, human beings are not warm blobs of
putty one can simply mold to be however one sees fit.</p>

<p>Playing sadistic social games is simply how normal people are. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in
their nature. Nothing that is in accordance with nature can truly be evil. Our
lives are in many ways a journey to realise our nature and act in harmony with
it. Cicero once argued that true law is right reason in agreement with
nature. So I feel that educational policy should be no exception. But the great
tyranny of modernity is that we do the opposite&mdash;we force people to contradict
their nature to a completely unreasonable extent.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so much simpler to just segregate nerds and muggles. It would literally
make bullying stop overnight.  Furthermore, it&rsquo;d allow geeks to feel a sense of
comaraderie, rather than the profound alienation they experience in a
mismanaged setting full of people with whom they share little in common. But
most importantly, geeks and non-geeks would be able to simply <em>be
themselves</em>&mdash;no brainwashing or guilt required!</p>

<p>Segregation is the common sense solution no one wants to hear. And it doesn&rsquo;t
just work for nerds. A very knowing feminist lady of mine acquaintance in
London has also informed me that sexual assault is a huge problem in
universities. So I told her we could totally end rape culture tomorrow, simply
by sending men and women to separate college campuses.</p>

<p>I know, I know&hellip; This stuff just makes <em>too much</em> sense. So much sense in
fact, that segregation is what we used to do for hundreds of years. It worked.
So why did we stop? Why are people opposed to nerd and gender segregation
today?</p>

<p>The only possible reason I could imagine, would be if one felt uniformity in
education to be some sort of moral imperative. But I personally consider this a
weak argument, considering morality is generally quite subjective and
oftentimes fleeting. Theologians on <a href="http://youtu.be/hR8ADuqrGx8?list=UUWB0dvorHvkQlgfGGJR2yxQ">Tumblr</a> are constantly inventing
new moral imperatives. Like one week it&rsquo;s <a href="http://asexualawarenessweek.com/">asexual awareness</a> and the
next it&rsquo;s <a href="http://gawker.com/5940947/from-otherkin-to-transethnicity-your-field-guide-to-the-weird-world-of-tumblr-identity-politics">otherkin inclusiveness</a>. It&rsquo;s hard to keep up with all
this progressive doctrine.</p>

<p>Ideology should not be placed before the health and safety of our children. We
have an obligation to provide for their safety and ensure a high standard of
living. Any struggles we force them to endure, should focus specifically on
developing their unique talents as individuals. And for geeks, intellectual
rigors are the most appropriate.</p>

<p>Different people are different. Our differences are what make us beautiful. The
utilisation of different people, with different sets of strengths, is what
makes our society strong. So any sane sensible policy ought to recognise and
embrace this simple truth about reality. This may seem obvious to you, my dear
reader; however to many progressives, it&rsquo;s just the craziest thing imaginable.</p>

<p>I encourage policy-makers to seek out ways to tailor their rules and laws to
accomodate different people differently. This should be done in a formal rather
than <em>de facto</em> manner. Formalising such arrangements does contradict one of
the fundamental tenets of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism">liberalism</a>. However I suspect such
policies represent a tremendous opportunity for leaders who should choose to be
so bold.</p>

<h2>Workplace Segregation</h2>

<p><img src="https://the-good-news.storage.googleapis.com/assets/img/hackerloft.jpg"

<div class="dropcap"></div>

<p>One thing I hope will comfort younger geeks in school, is that things do indeed
get better as you get older. For example, colleges have <em>de facto</em> nerd
segregation, by virtue of the fact that <acronym title="Science Technology
Engineering Mathematics">STEM</acronym> majors generally attend different
classes from everyone else. However what&rsquo;s even more interesting, is that many
of the companies that hire large numbers of engineers, have
<span>success</span>fully implemented policies that keep them segregated from
other types of workers.</p>

<p>This is generally described by the term &ldquo;engineering culture&rdquo; and you see it
most often at companies that are founded by engineers. It basically works as
follows: you put the salespeople in a different part of the building, and you
keep the suits as far away from the geeks as possible. That way the engineers
can work in peace. Extra points if the people who manage engineers, are also
engineers. And you know what? This is just the most awesome idea imaginable.</p>

<p>At nearly every other company, you see the total opposite. Engineers will be a
small minority, will be managed by suits, and forced to share the same work
environments as muggles. This might not sound so bad, but it has a strong
tendency to decrease the productivity and job <span>satis</span>faction of the
engineers, yet not for other employees.</p>

<p>This is because in integrated work environments, everyone just walks all over
the engineers. They treat them as their subordinates. They understand little
about what they do, and consider them blue-collar cogs who exist to fix their
computers. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they make a third of an engineer&rsquo;s salary.
They still feel entitled to assert dominance.</p>

<p>Geeks who refuse to tolerate this treatment often make the mistake of
politicking in response. These sorts of political games tend to be rigged
against their favour. Many geeks don&rsquo;t even care enough to try. Perhaps because
they became accustomed to subordination in their schooling, or maybe they&rsquo;re
too enthralled with their actual work to have time for unproductive activities.
So the only winning move is not to play.</p>

<p>A better strategy would be for engineers to band together and form their own
enclaves. It is only by carving out a nexus of power, that geeks can perform
their duties on terms of equality. Power is the only thing that suits respect.
So once geeks gain this respect, they can finally begin to have more cordial
and cooperative interactions with the other parts of the company.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, this is what engineering cultures <em>already do</em>. However
I don&rsquo;t think anyone has yet to describe it as segregation. It&rsquo;s just the
logical thing that works. And guess which companies are currently winning and
taking over the world? You guessed it&mdash;the ones with segregated engineering
cultures.</p>

<h2>Clashing Castes</h2>

<p>I witnessed similar social dynamics through my immersion in activism with
Occupy. I ran the <a href="https://occupywallst.org/">OccupyWallSt.org</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/occupywallst">@OccupyWallSt</a>
media properties. Because Occupy was a decentralised movement where anyone who
wanted to could participate, part of my job was interacting with the people &ldquo;on
the ground&rdquo; who showed up and staged protests, so I could amplify their voices
to the world.</p>

<p>Activists are the extreme opposite of engineers, in the sense that activists
stratify their social environments based <em>exclusively</em> on charisma. They do
this to such an extreme, that they&rsquo;ll actively attack those whom they perceive
as having high intelligence, which they associate with power, authority, and
oppression.</p>

<p>I spent many years trying to get these sorts of people to love me, loyally
serving them, and being kind to them in all sorts of ways. But I eventually
came to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>

<p>Every single one of us, whether we admit it to ourselves or not, has an
algorithm in our brains that says, &ldquo;this person is better than that person.&rdquo; We
rank others based on how much they exhibit the trait we value most in
people. The main ones people use are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Intelligence (scientists, engineers, scholars, priests)</li>
<li>Wealth/Power (businessmen, politicians, merchants)</li>
<li>Physical Strength (jocks, soldiers)</li>
<li>Charisma/Attractiveness (everyone else)</li>
</ol>

<p>Which one of these traits we prefer is completely hardwired into our
biology. We can&rsquo;t change it. And the worst part is that it&rsquo;s extremely
difficult to see eye to eye with people who value a trait different from ours.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t take credit for this insight. I&rsquo;m basically just appropriating the
things I&rsquo;ve heard about the traditional Hindu caste system. The only difference
is that I&rsquo;ve conjectured an empirically verifiable definition. I like caste
theory. I love how it adds an entirely new dimension to class analysis.  So I&rsquo;m
honestly baffled that it never found its way into the western tradition.</p>

<p>So the problem I had working with Occupiers, being the super-smart
socially-awkward nerd, was that I was at the <em>rock-bottom</em> of their hierarchy,
but at the top of mine! This led to a rift in our social expectations, which
resulted in conflict. I figured since I was smart (and basically controlled
everything), that I was entitled to respect, and that I should take the
initiative in getting things done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, everyone else thought I was some undesirable loser who was throwing
her weight around. It infuriated them that I wouldn’t submit myself to their
self-appointed charismatic leaders. Whenever I accomplished anything, rather
than thanking me, they&rsquo;d be furious I acted out of my place. So then they’d
attack me, and try to put me in my place.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I’d have absolutely no idea why these people kept attacking
me for no reason. I was shocked that they wouldn’t be grateful for all that I
was doing to help them. It infuriated me that they would literally sit around
in meetings, trying to devise ways to boss me around. I considered them
unskilled unintelligent parasites.</p>

<p>So when Occupiers made their utterly pathetic and obnoxious attempts to put me
in my place&mdash;I’d respond by putting <em>them</em> in their place. Thankfully for me,
intelligence plus control always trumps charisma. It&rsquo;s one of the privileges of
being in the upper caste. But it certainly was exhausting, putting down all
those micro-rebellions.</p>

<p>But the more they lost, the angrier they got. They quickly realised that the
only power they had, was the power to make my life miserable. So they continued
to gossip and lie with the intent of turning me into a social pariah. This is
why, if you Google my name, you&rsquo;ll see so many media hit pieces attacking me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last
I grapple with thee; from hell&rsquo;s heart I stab at thee; for hate&rsquo;s sake, I
spit my last breath at thee. &mdash;Moby Dick</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The social justice warriors within Occupy cannibalised the movement out of
prejudice and spite. This is why there hasn&rsquo;t been any justice for the millions
of Americans who had their homes and retirement funds stolen by Wall Street.</p>

<p>These conflicts could have easily been avoided, had I only been smart enough to
realise that people like me need to stay <em>far away</em> from people like them.
Geeks and activist-types are natural enemies. No amount of competence or
benevolence on my part would have changed that. No matter what I did, they&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve
always considered me a tyrant from their dreaded outgroup.</p>

<p>Reflecting on mine experiences, I&rsquo;ve come to understand that I shouldn&rsquo;t have
tried to help them. The mob serves but one purpose&mdash;<em>to be used</em>. I shouldn&rsquo;t
have pitied them; I shouldn&rsquo;t have tried to empower them; and I certainly
shouldn&rsquo;t have expected them to love me. I was a fool.</p>

<h2>Organic Hierarchy</h2>

<p>Social harmony comes when everyone understands their place; and order is
maintained so long as placement accurately reflects the reality of our natural
differences. Ideally these arrangements should develop organically, by people
voluntarily organising themselves into hierarchies based on an implicit pecking
order.</p>

<p>Stratifying our social circles is something we mammals just love to do. We
don&rsquo;t even consciously think about it. It happens in an unvocalised manner
every single day. We defer to the people we respect; we command those who look
to us for guidance; we obey those we fear; we work to please those on whom we
depend.</p>

<p>Hierarchies are so common in our social lives, that the ones which become
formalised are really the <em>exception</em> to the rule. Therefore one might posit
the existence of a theoretically ideal social arrangement in which all
hierarchy is organic and formal authority is not required. This is actually
anarchist political theory in a nutshell, if you surgically remove all the
leftism and kick out the capitalism fanboys.</p>

<p>But our natural mechanisms for building hierarchies break down when you mix
people who stratify differently. If people disagree about what a hierarchy
looks like, one of two things will happen:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the absence of authority, conflict ensues. Individuals will vie for power
until the disagreement is resolved. They will be very nasty and brutish too,
because they’ll feel slighted by others for depriving them of what they feel
is rightfully theirs. The winning faction will then codify its perception of
hierarchy and impose it upon the others.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing authority steps in to end the conflict by putting the fear in
everyone. Basically, authority has to become more authoritarian to maintain
order. Then you end up with an equilibrium where no one’s happy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Taking these things into consideration, we begin to develop a concept of formal
authority as being a stopgap we use when natural order doesn&rsquo;t work so
smoothly. I mean, nature is never wrong, but sometimes she&rsquo;s a cruel mistress
who thinks the solution to our problems is a nice darwinian bloodbath. Which is
exactly why we invented authoritarianism&mdash;to smooth those nasty bits over and
build a <em>civil</em> society.</p>

<p>But as much as I love legitimate authority, I personally consider the
<em>excercise</em> of authority to be something that&rsquo;s better to be avoided. Using
power is bad for rulers, because it burns power. Using power is also bad for
proles, who get a boot stomped in their face.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I heartily accept the motto, &ldquo;That government is best which governs least&rdquo;;
and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically.
Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe&mdash;&ldquo;That
government is best which governs not at all&rdquo;; and when men are prepared for
it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. &mdash;Henry David
Thoreau</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So perhaps the question we should be asking ourselves is, what can we do to
help our natural mechanisms for maintaining order work more smoothly, so that
we may reduce our dependence on formal authority? One such answer would be the
segregation of groups prone to conflict.</p>

<p>Now I personally identify as a <em>nerd nationalist</em>. I mean this in the sense
that I genuinely believe geeks are a nation, and that our nation should come
first. Furthermore, I reckon we could have something pretty close to utopia, if
only we could create a society for <em>geeks only</em>. We&rsquo;ve been trying to do
something similar for techies in the Bay Area, but the government and media
have fought us at every turn. They think that <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Streets-of-San-Francisco-drenched-in-urine-4658210.php">filthy</a> muggles are
entitled to live in the same cities as us.</p>

<p>The fact that segregation is so taboo is particularly telling. It&rsquo;s almost as
if the government is <em>intentionally</em> trying to break down our natural
mechanisms for maintaining order, simply to make us more dependent on the
state. A society with lots of disorder (e.g. muggles throwing bricks at our
charter buses), is a society that requires a big authoritarian government to
<em>enforce</em> order with an iron fist. A people without strong communities
practicing solidarity, is a people more easily controlled.</p>

<p>Is this really what we want?</p>
